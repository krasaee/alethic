# Alethic-ISM

_– Instruction-Based State Machine for Composable Analytic Workflows_  
_– Research Workbench for Computational Reasoning_

_(Status: Experimental)_

---

**Alethic-ISM** is an experimental system for composing and executing directed graphs of instruction-based state transitions. It enables orchestration and computation across domains including _AI pipelines, research workflows, agent modeling, and normative structural analysis_.

Its modular architecture includes a core execution engine, processors, API services, routing and streaming components, and a visual web-based editor for composing, inspecting, and executing live computation graphs. 

The system integrates seamlessly with AI models, structured data, and executable code, supporting real-time, distributed execution through a publish-subscribe model and dynamic workload management. It is designed to scale across data-intensive workflows and streaming pipelines.

Instructions can invoke code, query data, direct large language models, or perform structured transformations. Each node applies an instruction to an input state via a processor, producing a new, versioned, immutable output state. Together, these nodes form computable workflows that are fully executable, traceable and reproducible.

The system is experimental and is under active development as part of Bioethics with AI research supported by the University of Oxford and the National University of Singapore, with previous research support from Princeton University.

## Core Architecture

Alethic-ISM is built on a modular, extensible, and interoperable architecture:

- **Immutable State Transitions**: All computation flows through transformations of immutable, versioned states.
- **Instruction Graphs**: Workflows are represented as directed graphs. Each node specifies a processor, an instruction, and its inputs.
- **Execution Engine**: Resolves dependencies, evaluates nodes, and routes outputs through the graph.
- **Processors**: Modules that define how instructions are interpreted (e.g., OpenAI, Python, Anthropic).
- **State Store & Router**: Persist and route states between graph segments, enabling distributed execution.
- **API Services**: Provide access for submitting, inspecting, or modifying workflows via REST or streaming interfaces.
- **Alethic Studio**: A visual web interface for building, executing, and analyzing workflows.

## Execution Model

Each graph execution begins with one or more input states and proceeds via instruction nodes.

- Each node: `Input state → Instruction → Output state`
- Output state is versioned and has a unique ID
- Graphs can be executed incrementally or fully
- All transitions are recorded for inspection and replay

---

## Outputs

Each run produces:

- Final and intermediate states (all versioned)
- Instruction-level metadata (type, processor, duration, dependencies)
- Logs of model completions or function returns
- Full execution trace (`state_trace.json`)
- Optional exports: JSON summaries, CSV tables, serialized replay data

---

## Quickstart
Detailed documentation and examples for these projects are forthcoming.

The quickest way to get started is to use the provided Helm charts and deploy it on a local [k8s kind cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), this will setup the basic infrastructure for the ISM system, including the core components and a few example processors.
